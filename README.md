# UnityGestureQRCodeDetection

### 1. Place the `zxing.dll` file into the `Assets/Plugins directory`.
### 2. Select the `SampleScene.unity` in the `Assets/Scenes` folder within the Unity Editor to set it as the starting scene for the app.
### 3. In the `Update` method within `handsample.cs` located at `Assets/CoreXR/Scripts/`, we import a Texture2D frame image into the `GetQRcodeInfo` method in order to detect QR codes.
